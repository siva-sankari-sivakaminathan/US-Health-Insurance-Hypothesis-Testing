The world of US health insurance can be a complex one, and understanding the factors influencing costs is crucial. I recently embarked on a data analysis journey using a US health insurance dataset, and here's what I encountered:

✔Challenges:

Data Quality: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data type consistency were essential steps to ensure reliable analysis.

Normality Testing: Determining if data followed a normal distribution was crucial for selecting appropriate statistical tests.

Choosing the Right Test: Matching the test to the research question (e.g., t-test for comparing means, ANOVA for multiple groups) was critical for drawing sound conclusions.

✔Statistical Methods:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Unveiling data distributions, relationships between variables (correlation coefficients, scatter plots), and potential outliers (boxplots, histograms).

Hypothesis Testing:

Impact of Demographics: T-tests for comparing charges between genders and age groups (ANOVA for multiple age groups).

Lifestyle Factors: T-tests for comparing charges between smokers and non-smokers, correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman) for assessing the relationship between BMI and charges.

Regional Variations: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test (for non-normal data) to compare charges across regions.

Number of Children: ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test to assess the influence of children on charges.
